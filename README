run basecomms,js

getSensors.js connects to db1, gets company db details and names, connects to company db's and gets bases and sensor serials that are hybrid only
stores them in array for basecomms

basecomms waits for getSensors to complete array
opens TCP sockets for incoming base messages
parses base serial from incoming messages and compares against array, if we have a match then print the serial numbers that are hybrid
user hybrid serial numbers to create a sensor list for the base "ts" string, encode the serial numbers in the "ts" string and send to base
wait for base response
base should reply back with data for those sensor/sensors
parse incoming sensor data
publish to company topic/base serial/sensor serial (hardcoded for thermalsystems) currently due to now knowing where the mqtt topic is listed per customer 
publish the data to the mqtt broker to be consumed by sebs code and added to database


*****to do ***

implement a redo of getSensors every 5 minutes or create listener databases on change
create longer timeout delay for connecting to databases
try and use sebs code again to do the above with a connection pool
push more data to see how much it can handle
create failover mechanisms/restarts
